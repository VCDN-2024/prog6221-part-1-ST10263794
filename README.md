The Recipe App is a command-line application designed to help users manage and scale recipes. With this app, users can enter details for a recipe, including ingredients and steps, view the full recipe, scale the recipe by a factor, reset ingredient quantities to their original values, and clear all data to enter a new recipe. When you enter the app, you will be greeted with several options. You are going to pick the first option to enter your recipe details. This is where you will enter your name of what you want to make and the steps needed to make it. Afterwards you can choose to display your recipe, edit your recipe or delete it. There will be options to change the scale and quantities of the ingredients for your recipe.
